# Firebot Scripts
Community Created Scripts for use with Firebot's Custom Script functionality.

## Submitting a Script
If you'd like to submit a script you can do so by entering a pull request. Your pull request should consist of a folder for your script, the script itself and all requirements in a .zip file, and a manifest.json file which is used for providing information to the website at firebot.pro.

One of the members of Team Crowbar will take a look at your script to make sure it does not contain any malicious content, and then once the pull request is accepted we'll get it posted to Firebot.pro.

## Updating a Script
You can update your script in much the same way you submitted it. Simply open a pull request for us and we'll take a look and accept the request. Make sure to update your manifest.json file with the correct version and any patch notes. At this point if your script is already listed on Firebot.pro it will use the new manifest information to pull in details.

## Rules
- We can't accept any copyright content. Even if you have permission to use it, others will not. 
- You must be okay with people taking and modifying your scripts. Everything here is open source and available for people to modify. However, we will only accept pull requests to update scripts from the creator of that script.
- Be aware the rules could update at any point, and if your script violates a rule it might be pulled. In this case we'll do our best to contact you to let you know.
